These documents serve as the canonical ground-truth technical description of the project. We intend to use them to both describe the current state of the project and provide technical reference for implementing new features. Writing outside of these documents should be assumed to be helpful context, but may be out of date or deprecated. These docs are the single source of ground-truth about the state of the project that can be assumed to be up-to-date and presently relevant.
